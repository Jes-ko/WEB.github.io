                        The impacts of climate change pose challenges for turtle populations. Rising temperatures can affect the nesting success of turtles. 
                        For example, warmer sands can influence the gender ratio of hatchlings, as the incubation temperature determines the sex of the offspring. 
                        Higher temperatures may result in more females, leading to an imbalance in populations. Additionally, sea level rise and changes in ocean 
                        currents can erode nesting beaches and disrupt nesting patterns.

                        Turtles often become unintentional victims of fishing activities. They can get entangled in fishing gear, such as nets, lines, and hooks. 
                        When unable to surface for air, turtles can drown. Bottom trawling, a fishing method that involves dragging a net along the seafloor, 
                        is particularly harmful to turtles, as they can get trapped and injured. Bycatch is a significant threat to turtle populations,
