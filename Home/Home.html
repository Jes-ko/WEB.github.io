                    Out of the seven living sea turtle species recorded in the world,
                    Sri Lanka is blessed to have five species reported along the beautiful
                    coastal belt of the island that is coming for nesting.

                    The Green Turtle is the most common in Sri Lankan waters. 
                    Growing to a maximum length of 1m and weighing about 250kg, an adult female 
                    can lay between 120 to 40 eggs at a time.
                    Then comes the critically endangered Hawksbill Turtle which is a bit rarer than the Green Turtle. 
                    Comparatively, it is much smaller, reaching a maximum length of 90cm and weighing about 50 to 70kg. 
                    The Hawksbill gets its name from its narrow head and bird-like beak, which is used to catch animals hiding in small crevices.
                    Although it is smaller, this one is renowned for its beautiful shell,
                    which is made up of 13 symmetrical colorful pieces.

                        Turtle hatching season in Sri Lanka is known to be from November – May. 
                        With their peak seasons between January – March.
                        It's also good to know that <br> Sri Lanka has two monsoon seasons, 
                        a North East monsoon (between October and January)
                        as well as a South West monsoon, <br> (between May and July).

                    Female turtles lay their eggs on sandy beaches, including those in Rekawa, Kosgoda, and Pigeon Island.
                    The eggs incubate for about 45 to 60 days,  with temperature affecting the gender of the hatchlings.
                    After incubation, the hatchlings emerge and make their way to the ocean, guided by natural light. 
                    Human activities pose challenges, but conservation efforts and projects aim to protect the turtles. 
                    Visitors can witness this phenomenon and participate in educational programs and guided tours at turtle hatcheries, 
                    raising awareness and contributing to their survival.
